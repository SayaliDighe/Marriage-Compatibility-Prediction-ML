# Marriage Compatibility Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts marriage compatibility using machine learning techniques based on personal, family, and lifestyle-related features. The project was completed as part of my Data Science internship at Capabl (Elite Techno Groups).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Created and analyzed marriage compatibility dataset
2. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Applied data preprocessing techniques
4. Trained classification models
5. Evaluated model performance

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Results
- Achieved good accuracy on test data
- Identified key features influencing compatibility
- Built a simple and interpretable ML pipeline
